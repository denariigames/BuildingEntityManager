Addon for [MMORPG Kit](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/systems/mmorpg-kit-2d-3d-survival-110188) saves BuildingEntity prefabs to the MySql buildings table from the Editor.

Kit BuildingEntities are saved at run-time. BuildingEntity Manager enables saving from the Editor, enabling the world to be prepopulated with BuildingEntities.

You can access the Manager from the *MMORPG KIT > Denarii Games > BuildingEntity Manager* menu.

### Setup
